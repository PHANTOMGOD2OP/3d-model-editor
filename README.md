## Description

This project was built using a tutorial by [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqEa8fTxypQ) on youtube.

This is a 3D T-Shirt Designer application where users can design their own T-shirts using user-uploaded patterns and logos. The website includes technologies such as ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, and OpenAI.

⭐ Note: This website may require some time for the server to spin up and the 3D shirt to render. In addition, the AI functionality of this app may become unresponsive due to an inactive key, however users can still upload their own images.

ThreeJs-Project

## Introduction
Many large corporations already use 3D graphics to showcase their products. Here is a repo that helps you to understand how to use threejs and to build your own ThreeJS 3D product website and infuse it with the power of artificial intelligence! 
 
Libraries Used
- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

You'll also learn how to:
- Load, create and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lights, as well as understand the 3D world with a camera and positioning of an object in space.
- Make your code reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices
- Add custom color and file support.
- Generate and use images through DALLE AI
- Download the resulting t-shirt model image
- Ensure responsiveness across all devices and improve your site's performance
